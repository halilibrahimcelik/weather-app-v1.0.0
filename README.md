The purpose of this project is to make a weather application using the https://api.openweathermap.org api. 

It is to bring and display the weather conditions of the location desired by the user. 

I used axios library to fetch data from the API.  

(Sometimes there might be problem getting data from the server please be patient, if you still face with  problem regarding displaying weather info,please keep in touch with me )
